        "A cephalopod (pronounced ) is any member of the mollusc an class Cephalopoda ( Greek plural , ''kephalópoda''. \\\"head-feet\\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry , a prominent head, and a set of arm s or tentacle s ( muscular hydrostat s) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish , referring to their common ability to squirt ink . The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology . Cephalopods became dominant during the Ordovician period, represented by primitive nautiloids . The class now contains two, only distantly related, extant subclasses. Coleoidea , which includes octopus es, squid , and cuttlefish . and Nautiloidea , represented by '' Nautilus '' and '' Allonautilus ''. In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, whereas in the Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living species of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonoidea (ammonites) and Belemnoidea (belemnites). ==Distribution== There are around 800 extant species of cephalopod, although new species continue to be described. An estimated 11,000 extinct taxa have been described, although the soft-bodied nature of cephalopods means they are not easily fossilised. Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of Earth. None of them can tolerate freshwater , but the brief squid, '' Lolliguncula brevis '', found in Chesapeake Bay , may be a notable exception in that it tolerates brackish water . Cephalopods occupy most of the depth of the ocean, from the abyssal plain to the sea surface. Their diversity is greatest near the equator (~40 species retrieved in nets at 11°N by a diversity study) and decreases towards the poles (~5 species captured at 60°N). == Nervous system and behavior == Cephalopods are widely regarded as the most intelligent of the invertebrate s, and have well developed senses and large brain s (larger than those of gastropod s). The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates and their brain-to-body-mass ratio falls between that of endotherm ic and ectotherm ic vertebrates. The brain is protected in a cartilaginous cranium. The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been widely used for many years as experimental material in neurophysiology . their large diameter (due to lack of myelination ) makes them relatively easy to study compared with other animals. Cephalopods are social creatures. when isolated from their own kind, they will sometimes shoal with fish. Some cephalopods are able to fly through the air for distances of up to 50 m. While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion. water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in the air. The animals spread their fins and tentacles to form wings and actively control lift force with body posture. One species, '' Todarodes pacificus '', has been observed spreading tentacles in a flat fan shape with a mucus film between the individual tentacles while another, '' Sepioteuthis sepioidea ,'' has been observed putting the tentacles in a circular arrangement. ==Senses== Cephalopods have advanced vision, can detect gravity with statocyst s, and have a variety of chemical sense organs. Octopuses use their arms to explore their environment and can use them for depth perception. ===Vision===  eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera .]] Most cephalopods rely on vision to detect predators and prey, and to communicate with one another. Consequently, cephalopod vision is acute. training experiments have shown that the common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. The morphological construction gives cephalopod eyes the same performance as sharks'. however, their construction differs, as cephalopods lack a cornea, and have an everted retina. Cephalopods' eyes are also sensitive to the plane of polarization of light. Surprisingly—given their ability to change color—all octopuses and most cephalopods are color blind . When camouflaging themselves, they use their chromatophores to change brightness and pattern according to the background they see, but their ability to match the specific color of a background may come from cells such as iridophore s and leucophore s that reflect light from the environment. They also produce visual pigments throughout their body, and may sense light levels directly from their body. Evidence of color vision has been found in the sparkling enope squid (''Watasenia scintillans''), which achieves color vision by the use of three distinct retinal molecules (A1, sensitive to red. A2, to purple, and A4, to yellow?) which bind to its opsin . Unlike many other cephalopods, nautilus es do not have good vision. their eye structure is highly developed, but lacks a solid lens . They have a simple \\\" pinhole \\\" eye through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction as the primary sense for foraging , as well as locating or identifying potential mates. ===Hearing=== Some squids have been shown to detect sound using their statocyst s. ==Use of light==  (''Sepia latimanus'') can go from camouflage tans and browns (top) to yellow with dark highlights (bottom) in less than a second.]] Most cephalopods possess chromatophore s - colored pigment cells that expand and contract in accordance with their counterparts to produce color and pattern - which they can use in a startling array of fashions. As well as providing camouflage with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, shining light downwards to disguise their shadows from any predators that may lurk below. The bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts. the host cephalopod is able to detect the light produced by these organisms. Bioluminescence may also be used to entice prey, and some species use colorful displays to impress mates, startle predators, or even communicate with one another. It is not certain whether bioluminescence is actually of epithelial origin or if it is a bacterial production. === Coloration === Cephalopods can change their colors and patterns in milliseconds, whether for signalling (both within the species and for warning ) or active camouflage , as their chromatophores are expanded or contracted. \\\"integument (mollusks).\\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD Coloration is typically stronger in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean, whose functions tend to be restricted to disruptive camouflage . Evidence of original coloration has been detected in cephalopod fossils dating as far back as the Silurian . these orthoconic individuals bore concentric stripes, which are thought to have served as camouflage. Devonian cephalopods bear more complex color patterns, of unknown function. ==Ink== With the exception of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus belonging to the suborder Cirrina , all known cephalopods have an ink sac, which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink to confuse predator s. This sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the hind gut. It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents – almost pure melanin – can be squirted. its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion. The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with mucus , produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a smokescreen . However, a more sophisticated behaviour has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a Pseudomorph ). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey. For more information, see Inking behaviors . The inking behaviour of cephalopods has led to a common name of \\\"inkfish\\\", primarily used in fisheries science and the fishing industry , paralleling the terms white fish , oily fish , and shellfish . ==Circulatory system== Cephalopods are the only mollusks with a closed circulatory system. Coleoid s have two gill heart s (also known as branchial heart s) that move blood through the capillaries of the gill s. A single systemic heart then pumps the oxygenated blood through the rest of the body. Like most molluscs, cephalopods use hemocyanin , a copper-containing protein, rather than hemoglobin , to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue when exposed to air. ==Respiration== Cephalopods exchange gases with the seawater by forcing water through their gills, which are attached to the roof of the organism. Water enters the mantle cavity on the outside of the gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes. When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel. The water's expulsion through the funnel can be used to power jet propulsion. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of other molluscs, are attached to the ventral surface of the mantle cavity. There is a trade-off with gill size regarding lifestyle. To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small—water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size. However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion. thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary. The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles. The gills of cephalopods are supported by a skeleton of robust fibrous proteins. the lack of mucopolysaccharides distinguishes this matrix from cartilage. The gills are also thought to be involved in excretion, with NH 4 + being swapped with K + from the seawater. == Locomotion and buoyancy ==  While most cephalopods can move by jet propulsion, this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propellor -driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency ) is a more efficient model than rocket efficiency. The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases. paralarva e are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era , as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fin s and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity. Whilst jet propulsion is never the sole mode of locomotion, the stop-start motion provided by the jets continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predator s. Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates, and they can out-accelerate most fish. The jet is supplemented with fin motion. in the squid, the fins flap each time that a jet is released, amplifying the thrust. they are then extended between jets (presumably to avoid sinking). Oxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gill s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the hyponome , created by a fold in the mantle. The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control the speed of the jet the organism can produce. The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morphology of animal. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions. Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators. Cephalopods employ a similar method of propulsion despite their increasing size (as they grow) changing the dynamics of the water in which they find themselves. Thus their paralarvae do not extensively use their fins (which are less efficient at low Reynolds number s) and primarily use their jets to propel themselves upwards, whereas large adult cephalopods tend to swim less efficiently and with more reliance on their fins. '' seen from the front, showing the opening of the hyponome]] Early cephalopods are thought to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as ''Nautilus'' does today. ''Nautilus'' is also capable of creating a jet by undulations of its funnel. this slower flow of water is more suited to the extraction of oxygen from the water. The jet velocity in ''Nautilus'' is much slower than in coleoid s, but less musculature and energy is involved in its production. Jet thrust in cephalopods is controlled primarily by the maximum diameter of the funnel orifice (or, perhaps, the average diameter of the funnel) and the diameter of the mantle cavity. Changes in the size of the orifice are used most at intermediate velocities. The absolute velocity achieved is limited by the cephalopod's requirement to inhale water for expulsion. this intake limits the maximum velocity to eight body-lengths per second, a speed which most cephalopods can attain after two funnel-blows. Water refills the cavity by entering not only through the orifices, but also through the funnel. Squid can expel up to 94% of the fluid within their cavity in a single jet thrust. To accommodate the rapid changes in water intake and expulsion, the orifices are highly flexible and can change their size by a factor of twenty. the funnel radius, conversely, changes only by a factor of around 1.5. Some octopus species are also able to walk along the sea bed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by rippling of a flap of muscle around the mantle. While most cephalopods float (i.e. are neutrally buoyant or nearly so. in fact most cephalopods are about 2-3% denser than seawater ), they achieve this in different ways. Some, such as '' Nautilus '', allow gas to diffuse into the gap between the mantle and the shell. others allow purer water to ooze from their kidneys, forcing out denser salt water from the body cavity. others, like some fish, accumulate oils in the liver. and some octopuses have a gelatinous body with lighter chlorine ion s replacing sulfate in the body chemistry. ==Shell== Nautilus es are the only extant cephalopods with a true external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo). in cuttlefish (''Sepia'' spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell ( cuttlebone ) that is internal in the adult. The same is true of the chitinous gladius of squid and octopuses. Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports , which are sometimes referred to as a \\\"shell vestige\\\" or \\\"gladius\\\". The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an internal shell, and some squid also lack a gladius. Interestingly, the shelled coleoids do not form a clade or even a paraphyletic group. The ''Spirula'' shell begins as an organic structure, and is then very rapidly mineralized. Shells that are \\\"lost\\\" may be lost by resorption of the calcium carbonate component. Females of the octopus genus '' Argonauta '' secrete a specialised paper-thin eggcase in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a \\\"shell\\\", although it is not attached to the body of the animal. The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the ammonite s, are extinct, but their shells are very common as fossil s. The deposition of carbonate, leading to a mineralized shell, appears to be related to the acidity of the organic shell matrix (see Mollusc shell ). shell-forming cephalopods have an acidic matrix, whereas the gladius of squid has a basic matrix. ==Head appendages== Cephalopods, as the name implies, have muscular appendages extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed '' tentacle s'', are actively involved in capturing prey. they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds ). In giant squid they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed '' arms '', and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth. these help to hold onto the prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, as the name suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed. The tentacle consists of a thick central nerve cord (which must be thick to allow each sucker to be controlled independently) surrounded by circular and radial muscles. Because the volume of the tentacle remains constant, contracting the circular muscles decreases the radius and permits the rapid increase in length. Typically a 70% lengthening is achieved by decreasing the width by 23%. The shorter arms lack this capability. The size of the tentacle is related to the size of the buccal cavity. larger, stronger tentacles can hold prey as small bites are taken from it. with more numerous, smaller tentacles, prey is swallowed whole, so the mouth cavity must be larger. Externally shelled nautilids ('' Nautilus '' and '' Allonautilus '') have on the order of 90 finger-like appendages, termed ''tentacles'', which lack suckers but are sticky instead, and are partly retractable. ==Feeding== , ''Architeuthis'' sp.]] All living cephalopods have a two-part beak . most have a radula , although it is reduced in most octopus and absent altogether in ''Spirula''. They feed by capturing prey with their tentacles, drawing it into their mouth and taking bites from it. They have a mixture of toxic digestive juices, some of which are manufactured by symbiotic algae, which they eject from their salivary glands onto their captured prey held in their mouth. These juices separate the flesh of their prey from the bone or shell. The salivary gland has a small tooth at its end which can be poked into an organism to digest it from within. The digestive gland itself is rather short. It has four elements, with food passing through the crop, stomach and caecum before entering the intestine. Most digestion, as well as the absorption of nutrients, occurs in the digestive gland, sometimes called the liver. Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the digestive gland through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum. Cells in the digestive gland directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel. Cephalopods tend to concentrate ingested heavy metals in their body tissue. === Radula === '' eating a crab]] The cephalopod radula consists of multiple symmetrical rows of up to nine teeth – thirteen in fossil classes. The organ is reduced or even vestigial in certain octopus species and is absent in '' Spirula ''. The teeth may be homodont (i.e. similar in form across a row), heterodont (otherwise), or ctenodont (comb-like). Their height, width and number of cusps is variable between species. The pattern of teeth repeats, but each row may not be identical to the last. in the octopus, for instance, the sequence repeats every five rows. Cephalopod radulae are known from fossil deposits dating back to the Ordovician. They are usually preserved within the cephalopod's body chamber, commonly in conjunction with the mandibles. but this need not always be the case. many radulae are preserved in a range of settings in the Mason Creek. Radulae are usually difficult to detect, even when they are preserved in fossils, as the rock must weather and crack in exactly the right fashion to expose them. for instance, radulae have only been found in nine of the 43 ammonite genera, and they are rarer still in non-ammonoid forms. only three pre-Mesozoic species possess one. == Excretory system == Most cephalopods possess a single pair of large nephridia . Filtered nitrogenous waste is produced in the pericardial cavity of the branchial heart s, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral vena cava project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts beat. This action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the mantle cavity through a pore. ''Nautilus'', unusually, possesses four nephridia, none of which are connected to the pericardial cavities. The incorporation of ammonia is important for shell formation in terrestrial molluscs and other non-molluscan lineages. Because protein (i.e. flesh) is a major constituent of the cephalopod diet, large amounts of ammonium are produced as waste. The main organs involved with the release of this excess ammonium are the gills. The rate of release is lowest in the shelled cephalopods '' Nautilus '' and '' Sepia '' as a result of their using nitrogen to fill their shells with gas to increase buoyancy. Other cephalopods use ammonium in a similar way, storing the ion s (as ammonium chloride ) to reduce their overall density and increase buoyancy. == Reproduction and life cycle == Cephalopods are a diverse group of species, but share common life history traits, for example they have a rapid growth rate and short life spans. Stearns (1992) suggested that in order to produce the largest possible number of viable offspring, spawning events depend on ecological environmental factors of the organism. The majority of cephalopods do not provide parental care to their offspring, except for example, octopus, which helps this organism increase the survival rate of their offspring. Marine species life cycles are affected by various environmental conditions. The development of a cephalopod embryo can be greatly affected by temperature, oxygen saturation, pollution, light intensity, and salinity. These factors are important to the rate of embryonic development and the success of hatching of the embryos. Food availability also plays an important role in the reproductive cycle of cephalopods. A limitation of food influences the timing of spawning along with their function and growth. Spawning time and spawning vary among marine species. it’s correlated with temperature, though cephalopods in shallow water spawn in cold months so that the offspring would hatch at warmer temperatures. Breeding can last from several days to a month. === Sexual maturity === Cephalopods that are sexually mature and of adult size, begin spawning and reproducing. After the transfer of genetic material to the following generation, the adult cephalopods then die. Sexual maturation in male and female cephalopods can be observed internally by the enlargement of gonads and accessory glands. Mating would be a poor indicator of sexual maturation in females. they can receive sperm when not fully reproductively mature and store them until they are ready to fertilize the eggs. Most cephalopod males develop a hectocotylus, an arm tip which is capable of transferring their spermatozoa into the female mantel cavity. Though not all species use a hectocotylus. for example Nautilus releases a spadix. An indication of sexual maturity of females is the development of brachial photophores to attract mates. === Fertilization === Cephalopods are not broadcast spawners. During the process of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wrapping his arm around her. either in a ‘male to female neck’ position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate the process of fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches. each egg is composed of a protective coat to ensure the safety of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid on den, it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators. === Male-male competition === Aggressive spawning is an activity that most cephalopods engage in. a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. Male- male aggression is seen in cephalopods. smaller males tend to lose these interactions. When a female is near the males charge on another continuously and begin to flair their arms. If neither male backed away, the arms extend to the back exposing the mouth which leads to the biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the buccal cavity that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is sneaker mating or mimicry- smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by different male. During this process, the sneaker males quickly insert drop like sperm into the seminal receptacle. === Mate choice === Mate choice is seen in cuttlefish species, where females prefer some males over others, though characteristics of the preferred males are unknown. A hypothesis states that females reject males by olfactory cues rather than visual cues. Several cephalopod species are polyandrous- accepting and storing multiple male spermatophores, which has been identified by DNA fingerprinting. Females are no longer receptive to mating attempts when holding their eggs in their arm. Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored. Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition. which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs. In order to reduce this sort of competition, males develop agonistic behaviors like mate guarding and flushing. Flushing is used by both the male and female. it is the process of removing spermatophores of other males by continuously pumping strong jets of water into the buccal cavity of the female. This behavior however, reduces the available time to mate with other females. === Sexual dimorphism === In a variety of marine organisms it is seen that females are larger in size compared to the males in some close related species. In some lineages, such as the blanket octopus, males become structurally smaller and smaller resembling a term, \\\"dwarfism\\\" dwarf males usually occurs at low densities. The blanket octopus male is an example of sexual-evolutionary dwarfism. females grow 10,000 to 40,000 times larger than the males and the sex ratio between males and females can be distinguished right after hatching of the eggs.  === Embryology === Cephalopod eggs span a large range of sizes, from 1 to 30 mm in diameter. [78] The fertilised ovum initially divides to produce a disc of germinal cells at one pole, with the yolk remaining at the opposite pole. The germinal disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in other molluscs, and only later migrate towards the head. The funnel of cephalopods develops on the top of their head, whereas the mouth develops on the opposite surface. The early embryological stages are reminiscent of ancestral gastropod s and extant Monoplacophora . The shells develop from the ectoderm as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralised. In ''Sepia'', which has an internal shell, the ectoderm forms an invagination whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited. === Development === '' paralarva e. Left.

Posteriorly the expanded vanes of the gladius are visible in the dorsal view. Right. Ventral and dorsal views of a very advanced paralarva.]] The length of time before hatching is highly variable. smaller eggs in warmer waters are the fastest to hatch, and newborns can emerge after as little as a few days. Larger eggs in colder waters can develop for over a year before hatching. The process from spawning to hatching follows a similar trajectory in all species, the main variable being the amount of yolk available to the young and when it is absorbed by the embryo. Unlike most other molluscs, cephalopods do not have a morphologically distinct larva l stage. Instead the juveniles are known as paralarvae . They quickly learn how to hunt, using encounters with prey to refine their strategies. Growth in juveniles is usually allometric , whilst adult growth is isometric . == Evolution == The traditional view of cephalopod evolution holds that they evolved in the Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran -like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was closely related to the gastropod s (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod '' Plectronoceras '' to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as '' Knightoconus '', which lacked a siphuncle. Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods. However, some morphological evidence is difficult to reconcile with this view, and the redescription of '' Nectocaris pteryx '', which did not have a shell and appeared to possess jet propulsion in the manner of \\\"derived\\\" cephalopods, complicated the question of the order in which cephalopod features developed – provided ''Nectocaris'' is a cephalopod at all. Their position within the Mollusca is currently wide open to interpretation - see Mollusca. Phylogeny . Early cephalopods were likely predators near the top of the food chain. They underwent pulses of diversification during the Ordovician period to become diverse and dominant in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas. In the Early Palaeozoic, their range was far more restricted than today. they were mainly constrained to sublittoral regions of shallow shelves of the low latitudes, and usually occur in association with thrombolites . A more pelagic habit was gradually adopted as the Ordovician progressed. " +
        "Professional boxing , or prizefighting , emerged in the early twentieth century as boxing gradually attained legitimacy and became a regulated, sanctioned sport. Professional boxing bouts are fought for a purse which is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referee. In contrast with amateur boxing , professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds, though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds. Protective headgear is not permitted, and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted. Professional boxing has enjoyed a much higher profile than amateur boxing throughout the 20th century and beyond. In Cuba professional boxing is banned. So was also the case in Sweden between 1970 and 2007, and Norway between 1981 and 2014. == Early history ==  In 1891, the National Sporting Club (N.S.C.), a private club in London, began to promote professional glove fights at its own premises, and created nine of its own rules to augment the Queensberry Rules . These rules specified more accurately the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of a fight. The British Boxing Board of Control (B.B.B.C.) was first formed in 1919 with close links to the N.S.C., and was re-formed in 1929 after the N.S.C. closed. In 1909, the first of twenty-two belts were presented by the fifth Earl of Lonsdale to the winner of a British title fight held at the N.S.C. In 1929, the B.B.B.C. continued to award Lonsdale Belt s to any British boxer who won three title fights in the same weight division. The \\\"title fight\\\" has always been the focal point in professional boxing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, there were title fights at each weight. Promoters who could stage profitable title fights became influential in the sport, as did boxers' managers. The best promoters and managers have been instrumental in bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking media and public interest. The most famous of all three-way partnership (fighter-manager-promoter) was that of Jack Dempsey (heavyweight champion 1919â€“1926), his manager Jack Kearns , and the promoter Tex Rickard . Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a \\\"golden age\\\" of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s. They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title fight (Dempsey v. Georges Carpentier , in 1921). In the United Kingdom, Jack Solomons ' success as a fight promoter helped re-establish professional boxing after the Second World War and made the UK a popular place for title fights in the 1950s and 1960s. In the first part of the 20th century, the United States became the centre for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the \\\"world champions\\\" were those listed by the '' Police Gazette ''. After 1920, the National Boxing Association (N.B.A.) began to sanction \\\"title fights\\\". Also during that time, '' The Ring '' was founded, and it listed champions and awarded championship belts. The N.B.A. was renamed in 1962 and became the World Boxing Association (W.B.A.). The following year, a rival body, the World Boxing Council (W.B.C.), was formed. In 1983, the International Boxing Federation (I.B.F.) was formed. In 1988, another world sanctioning body, World Boxing Organization (WBO) was formed. By the end of the 20th century, the World Professional Boxing Federation (W.P.B.F.) was formed, a boxer had to be recognized by the separate bodies to be the \\\" Undisputed World Champion \\\". Regional sanctioning bodies such as the North American Boxing Federation , the North American Boxing Council and the United States Boxing Association also awarded championships. ''Ring Magazine'' also continued listing the World Champion of each weight division, and its rankings continue to be appreciated by fans. ==Modern history== ===1900 to 1920=== In the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain, and champions were recognized by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day. Among the great champions of the era were the peerless heavyweight Jim Jeffries and Bob Fitzsimmons , who weighed less than 12 stone (164 pounds), but won world titles at middleweight (1892), light heavyweight (1903), and heavyweight (1897). Other famous champions included light heavyweight Philadelphia Jack O'Brien and middleweight Tommy Ryan . On May 12, 1902 lightweight Joe Gans became the first black boxing champion. Despite the public's enthusiasm, this was an era of far-reaching regulation of the sport, often with the stated goal of outright prohibition. In 1900, the State of New York enacted the Lewis Law, banned prizefights except for those held in private athletic clubs between members. Thus, when introducing the fighters, the announcer frequently added the phrase \\\"Both members of this club\\\", as George Wesley Bellows titled one of his paintings. The western region of the United States tended to be more tolerant of prizefights in this era, although the private club arrangement was standard practice here as well, San Francisco's California Athletic Club being a prominent example. On December 26, 1908, heavyweight Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion and a highly controversial figure in that racially charged era. Prizefights often had unlimited rounds, and could easily become endurance tests, favoring patient tacticians like Johnson. At lighter weights, ten round fights were common, and lightweight Benny Leonard dominated his division from the late teens into the early twenties. Prizefighting champions in this period were the premier sports celebrities, and a championship event generated intense public interest. Long before bars became popular venues in which to watch sporting events on television, enterprising saloon keepers were known to set up ticker machines and announce the progress of an important bout, blow by blow. Local kids often hung about outside the saloon doors, hoping for news of the fight. Harpo Marx, then fifteen, recounted vicariously experiencing the 1904 Jeffries-Munroe championship fight in this way. ===1920 to 1940===  In the 1920s, prizefighting was the pre-eminent sport in the United States, and no figure loomed larger than Jack Dempsey , who became world heavyweight champion after brutally defeating Jess Willard . Dempsey was one of the hardest punchers of all time and as Bert Randolph Sugar put it, \\\"had a left hook from hell.\\\" He is remembered for his iconic fight with Luis Ã\u0081ngel Firpo , which was followed by a lavish life of celebrity away from the ring. The enormously popular Dempsey would conclude his career with a memorable two bouts with Gene Tunney , breaking the $1 million gate threshold for the first time." +
        "Marvel Entertainment, LLC , formerly Marvel Enterprises and Toy Biz, Inc. , is an American entertainment company formed from the merger of Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. and Toy Biz, Inc. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company , and is mainly known for its Marvel Comics and Marvel Television divisions. Marvel Entertainment's former film division, Marvel Studios —which operated directly under the company from 1996 to 2015—is now a division of the Walt Disney Studios , where it currently develops and produces its own films based on Marvel characters . In 2009, Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment, Inc. for $4 billion, and has been a limited liability company (LLC) since then. For financial reporting purposes, Marvel is reported as primarily a part of Disney's Studio Entertainment or Consumer Products segments. Over the years, Marvel Entertainment has entered in several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across a variety of businesses. Marvel currently has a film licensing agreement with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures , and a theme park licensing agreement with Universal Parks & Resorts extant before Disney's acquisition. Aside from their contract with Universal, Marvel's characters and properties have also appeared at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , another Disney unit. ==History== ===Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.=== Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. (Marvel or MEG), incorporated on as the parent company of Marvel Comics and Marvel Productions , was put up for sale as part of the liquidation of its then parent corporation, Cadence Industries , and sold in 1986 to New World Pictures . On January 6, 1989, Ronald Perelman 's MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings group of companies bought Marvel Entertainment Group from New World for $82.5 million, not including Marvel Productions , which was folded into New World's TV and movie business. \\\"It is a mini-Disney in terms of intellectual property,\\\" said Perelman. \\\"Disney's got much more highly recognized characters and softer characters, whereas our characters are termed action heroes. But at Marvel we are now in the business of the creation and marketing of characters.\\\" ====Going Public and acquisition==== Marvel made an initial public offer of 40% of the stock (ticker symbol NYSE. MRV) on July 15, 1991, giving $40 million from the proceeds to Andrews Group, Marvel's then direct parent corporation within MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. Marvel Entertainment Group then began expanding with acquisitions and forming new divisions. Marvel purchased the trading card company Fleer on July 24, 1992. On April 30, 1993, Marvel acquired 46% of ToyBiz , for the rights to make Marvel toys. The Andrews Group named Avi Arad of ToyBiz as the president and CEO of the Marvel Films division and of New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary. In 1993 and 1994, Marvel's holding companies — Marvel Holdings, Inc. and Marvel Parent Holdings, Inc. — were formed between Andrews Group and MEG and issued over half a billion dollars in bonds under the direction of Perelman, secured by Marvel's rising stock, which was passed up in dividends to Perlman's group of companies. Marvel continued making acquisitions with Panini , an Italian sticker-maker on August 4, 1994 for $158.4 million, and SkyBox International on March 8, 1995 for $150 million. Marvel also purchased Heroes World Distribution , a regional distributor to comic-book shops on Dec. 28, 1994. Marvel's attempt to distribute its products directly led to a decrease in sales and aggravated the losses which Marvel suffered when the comic book bubble popped, the 1994 Major League Baseball strike massacred the profits of the Fleer unit, and Panini, whose revenue depended largely on Disney licensing, was hobbled by poor Disney showings at the box office. Raviv, pp. 38-39 ====Marvel Studios and bankruptcy==== While licensing revenue reached $50 million in 1995, MEG laid off 275 employees on January 4, 1996. As losses for the 1995 year were $48.4 million. On November 12, 1996 Perelman offered to have the Andrews Group purchase additional shares with an issue for $350 million in November 1996 (the \\\"Andrews Plan\\\"), which would have required ToyBiz to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Marvel. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn began buying Marvel's bonds at 20% of their value and moved to block Perelman's plan. The Marvel group of companies filed for bankruptcy on December 27, 1996, but the noteholders, led by Icahn, initially blocked this. In August 1996, Marvel created Marvel Studios , an incorporation of Marvel Films, due to the sale of its film and TV sister company, New World Communications Group , to News Corporation . Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold Toy Biz stocks, which Marvel had started and took public in February 1995. Icahn fought to take control of the company from Perelman. The court ruled on February 26, 1997 that Icahn could foreclose on a controlling interest in Marvel shares put up for collateral for the company's bonds. On April 28, 1997, a ToyBiz and Marvel agree to a plan supported by Chase Bank that would merge the two companies, grant then lenders a $250 million loan proceeds, a 5-year, $170 million note, 28% of merged entity's equity and all stock in subsidiaries Fleer/SkyBox and Panini subsidiaries with current Marvel shareholders receiving 2 sets of stock warrants. Finally Icahn takes control of Marvel's board and became Marvel's chairman on June 20. Bankruptcy proceedings continued with multi-way arguments among Perelman, Icahn, Toy Biz and the banks. A plan for reorganization agreed to by Icahn and the MEG's secured creditors falls apart on October 8 with the introduction of the better Toy Biz plan. The Bankruptcy Court on December 24 appointed a trustee to oversee the company. In June 1997, Marvel formed its Marvel Enterprise division, headed by president and CEO Scott C. Marden, to manage its trading card and sticker businesses, as well as Marvel Interactive, an Internet -entertainment and software-publishing company. A lawsuit by bond holders and Marvel's litigation trustees was filed in 1997, accusing Perelman and other Marvel Board Directors of diverting $553.5 million in proceeds from 1993 and 1994 notes to other MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings' companies, prior to Marvel's 1996 bankruptcy. The lawsuit asked for $470.8 million in damages. The appellate court ruled that, “None of the proceeds went to Marvel, or were used for Marvel’s benefit”, but instead improperly enriched the directors. While denying any wrongdoing, Perelman agreed in August 2008 to settle for $80 million, which the trustees accepted. The settlement fund, after paying off trustees' and legal fees, administrative expenses and a $2 million loan, had $50 million to distribute to some Marvel Entertainment Group shareholders and unsecured creditors. On February 18, 1998, Marvel and co-owner Universal Studios Hollywood opened Marvel Mania Restaurant near Universal Studios in California, as well as Planet Hollywood . However, Planet Hollywood had financial problems due to expanding too quickly, and closed Marvel Mania. Another Toy Biz reorganization plan supported by the most creditors is submitted to the court on February 13, 1998. New York Stock Exchange stops trading of Marvel stock on April 17. Toy Biz owners Ike Perlmutter and Avi Arad , with the banks on their side, snatched Marvel from Perelman and Icahn, in order to protect their own financial interests. Retailer and columnist Chuck Rozanski estimated that Perelman made $200 to $400 million from Marvel, while '' Forbes '' magazine believes he made nothing. and the judge in the Marvel bankruptcy trial estimated that Perelman made $280 million plus various tax advantages. The judge ousted Icahn as Marvel's chairman in December 1997, naming a trustee to run Marvel while discussion continued between the various factions. ===Marvel Enterprises=== ToyBiz and Marvel Entertainment Group were merged into Marvel Enterprises to bring it out of bankruptcy in June 1998. In February 1999, Fleer/Skybox was sold to a corporation owned by Alex and Roger Grass, a father and son, for US$30 million. Later, the rights to names like \\\"Spider-Man\\\" were being challenged. Toy Biz hired an attorney to review its license agreement. Los Angeles patent attorney Carole E. Handler found a legal loophole in the licensing of the Marvel name and was successful in reclaiming Marvel Enterprises' movie rights to its character Spider-Man. Marvel Enterprise organized itself into four major units, Marvel Studios, Toy Biz, Licensing and Publishing, while in November 1999 adding Marvel Characters Group to manage Marvel's IP and oversee marketing. In 2003, Bill Stine purchased back Quest Aerospace , a 1995 Toy Biz acquisition, from Marvel. In summer 2003, Marvel places an offer for Artisan Entertainment . A new unit, Marvel International, was set up in London under a president, Bruno Maglione, to extend the company's operation and presence in major overseas markets in November 2003. In December 2003, Marvel Entertainment acquired Cover Concepts from Hearst Communications, Inc. In November 2004, Marvel consolidated its children's sleepwear-apparel licensing business with American Marketing Enterprises, Inc. In November 2004, the corporation sued South Korea -based NCSoft Corp. and San Jose, California -based Cryptic Studios Inc. over possible trademark infringement in their ''City of Heroes'' massive multiplayer online game. Marvel settled a film-royalties lawsuit in April 2005 with its former editor-in-chief and publisher, Stan Lee , paying him $10 million and negotiating an end to his royalties. ====Marvel Entertainment==== In September 2005, Marvel Enterprises changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the corporation's expansion into financing its own movie slate. In 2007, several Stan Lee Media related groups filed lawsuits against Marvel Entertainment for $1 billion and for Lee's Marvel creations in multiple states most of which have been dismissed. Gardner, Eriq. [http. //www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/marvel-dodges-bullet-1-billion-97723 \\\"Marvel Dodges Bullet as $1 Billion Lawsuit over Stan Lee Company Is Dismissed\\\"], '' The Hollywood Reporter '', February 9, 2011. Additionally, a lawsuit over ownership of the character Ghost Rider was filed on March 30, 2007, by Gary Friedrich and Gary Friedrich Enterprises, Inc. ====Disney subsidiary==== On August 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4.24 billion, with Marvel shareholders to receive $30 and approximately 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they own. The voting occurred on December 31, 2009 and the merger was approved. The acquisition of Marvel was finalized hours after the shareholder vote, therefore giving Disney full ownership of Marvel Entertainment. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange under its ticker symbol (MVL), due to the closing of the deal. On June 2, 2010 Marvel announced that it promoted Joe Quesada to Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment. In June 2010, Marvel set up a television division headed by Jeph Loeb as executive vice president. Three months later, Smith & Tinker licensed from Marvel the character rights for a superhero digital collectible game for Facebook and Apple's mobile platform." +
        " Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American real estate developer, television personality, business author, and political candidate. He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization , and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts . Trump's career, branding efforts, lifestyle and outspoken manner helped make him a celebrity, a status amplified by the success of his NBC reality show, '' The Apprentice ''. Trump is a son of Fred Trump , a New York City real estate developer. Donald Trump worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , and officially joined the company in 1968. In 1971, he was given control of the company, renaming it The Trump Organization. Trump remains a major figure in American real estate and a celebrity for his prominent media exposures. On June 16, 2015, Trump formally announced his candidacy for president of the United States in the 2016 election , seeking the nomination of the Republican Party . Trump's early campaigning drew intense media coverage and saw him rise to high levels of popular support. Since late July 2015, he has consistently been the front-runner in public opinion polls for the Republican Party nomination. == Early life == Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the borough of Queens in New York City. He is the fourth of five children born to Mary Anne (nÃ©e MacLeod) and Fred Trump , who had married in 1936. His sister, Maryanne Trump Barry , is a United States federal judge on senior status for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit . Trump's mother was a Scottish immigrant, born on the Isle of Lewis , off the west coast of Scotland . Trump's paternal grandparents were German immigrants. Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf , was a successful Klondike Gold Rush restaurateur who anglicized the family name. In his 1987 book, '' The Art of the Deal '', Donald Trump incorrectly claimed that Friedrich Drumpf was of Swedish origin, an assertion previously made by Fred Trump for many years. Trump later acknowledged his German ancestry and served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City. While living in a two-story mock Tudor home on Wareham Place in Jamaica Estates , Trump attended the private Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills, Queens , where Fred Trump, Donald's father, was a member of the Board of Trustees. Some of his siblings also attended Kew-Forest. Trump's father told an interviewer in 1983 he \\\"was a pretty rough fellow when he was small\\\", prompting him to enroll his son in the New York Military Academy (NYMA) in eighth grade for the duration of his high school education. Trump participated in marching drills and wore a uniform, attaining the rank of \\\"cadet captain\\\" in his senior year. He told a biographer in 2015 that NYMA gave him \\\"more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military\\\". Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years, before transferring to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , because Wharton then had one of the few real estate studies departments in U.S. academia. He graduated in 1968, with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. Trump came of age for the draft during the Vietnam War . In an interview in 2011 on New York station WNYW, he stated, \\\"I actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number.\\\" Selective Service records retrieved by The Smoking Gun website from the National Archives show that, although Trump did eventually receive a high selective service lottery number in 1969, he was not drafted earlier because of four student deferments (2-S) while attending college, and after receiving a medical deferment (1-Y, later converted to 4-F) obtained in 1968 after his college graduation, prior to the lottery being initiated. Trump was deemed fit for service after a military medical examination in 1966, and was briefly classified as 1-A by a local draft board shortly before his 1968 medical disqualification. Trump attributed his medical deferment to \\\" heel spurs \\\" in both feet, according to a 2015 biographer, but told an Iowa campaign audience he suffered from a spur in one foot, though he could not remember which one. == Business career == Trump began his career at his father's real estate company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn , Queens, and Staten Island . One of Trump's first projects, while he was still in college, was the revitalization of the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati , Ohio, which his father had purchased for $5.7Â million in 1962. The Trumps became involved in the project and with a $500,000 investment, turned the 1,200-unit complex's occupancy rate from 34% to 100%. In 1972, the Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75Â million. In 1971, Trump moved to Manhattan and became involved in larger building projects and used attractive architectural design to win public recognition. Trump initially came to public attention in 1973, when he was accused by the Justice Department of violations of the Fair Housing Act in the operation of 39 buildings. Trump in turn accused the Justice Department of targeting his company because it was a large one, and to force it to rent to welfare recipients . Trump settled the charges in 1975, saying he was satisfied that the agreement did not \\\"compel the Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant.\\\" Trump made plans to acquire and develop the old Penn Central for $60Â million with no money down. Later, with the help of a 40-year tax abatement from the New York City government, he turned the bankrupt Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and created The Trump Organization . New York City had a plan to build the Javits Convention Center on property for which Trump held a right-to-buy option . Trump estimated his company could have completed the project for $110Â million but the city rejected his offer and Trump received a broker's fee on the sale of the property instead. Repairs on The Wollman Rink in Central Park (built in 1955) were started in 1980 with an expected 2Â½-year construction schedule but were nowhere near completion by 1986. Trump took over the management of the project, at no cost to the city, and completed it in three months for $1.95Â million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget. In 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal Casino in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International , which led to mounting debt, and by 1989," ;
